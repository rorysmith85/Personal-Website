          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I am a freelance journalist based in London. Previously, I worked as a teacher in Norway, with refugee integration in Gothenburg, Sweden, and in <a href="http://escalandofronteras.org/es/home-es/" target="_blank">gang prevention</a> in Monterrey, Mexico. During this time I also worked as a freelance
          journalist on the side.</p>
          <p>I have worked for a range of media organizations, including CNN, Vox, Vice, News Deeply, and Truthout among others, covering a range of issues from Afghani refugees, food justice,
          and the environmental effects of illegal marijuana farms in California, to organized crime in Mexico, test-tube rhinos, and the Swedish election.</p>
          <p>Having also trained as a data journalist, I am currently using Python, Pandas, JavaScript, and d3.js for my work.</p>
          <p>Among my investigative interests are: organized crime, human trafficking, drug policy, the militarization of Europe's borders, corruption,
          farm politics, and the international food system.</p>
